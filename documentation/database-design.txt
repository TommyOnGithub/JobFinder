--A description of the structure and function of the database--

There are 6 tables in the database so far; 3 tables for the users
and 3 tables for the functionality.

The User table is the master table for all the registered members
of the site. It includes their real name, username, and password.
Along with it are the Faculty and Admin tables, which list users
which have special access to the site. Users in the Faculty table
can view student profiles and match students to jobs and degrees.
Users in the Admin table can view and edit other profiles on the
site.

The Student, Job, and Degree table provide the data for the main
functionality of the site. Each table has a column for each skill we
have identified, and a number from 1 to 5. For the Student table,
it indicates their strength in that skill. For Degree, it's whether
the degree teaches that skill. For Job, it indicates how heavily
that job requires that skill. Our matching algorithm will crunch
the skills columns of each of these tables.

Additionally, the Student table documents some basic information
about the student.
