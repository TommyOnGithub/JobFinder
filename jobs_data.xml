	<title>Database Administrator</title>
	<description>
		Database administrators, "DB admins", or DBAs are the gatekeepers of
		the world's data. DBAs use computers to store data in an organized and
		secure manner so that it can be accessed at any time by authorized
		individuals and never by bad actors. Most people don't know what a DBA
		is or what they do, but without them we would all be hoarding canned goods
		and ammunition and warming up at the end of the day huddled around a
		trashcan fire.
